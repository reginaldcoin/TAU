  <p class="title">54. Cultivating and Observing.</p>
  The good planter, he who plants virtue, never uproots..   
  <br><br>The good embraceor, he who embraces virtue, never lets go. 
  <br><br>His sons and grandsons will offer sacrifice to him without ceasing.
  <br><br>Whoever cultivates this in his person, his virtue  will be  true.  
  <br><br>Whoever  cultivates  this in his family, his virtue will be abundant. 
  <br><br>Whoever cultivates this in his village, his virtue will extend. 
  <br><br>Whoever cultivates this in his kingdom, his virtue will be exuberant. 
  <br><br>Who-ever cultivates this in the world, his virtue will be universal.
  <br><br>Therefore by observing myself I know others; 
  <br>by observing my family, other families;
  <br>by observing one kingdom, other kingdoms; 
  <br><br>by observing the existing world, other worlds.
  <br><br>How do I know the natural course of events in the world, but in this way?
