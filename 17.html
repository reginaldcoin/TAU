  <p class="title">17. Genuineness.</p>
In the highest antiquity people knew only of the existence of their superiors. 
<br><br>In the next age: they became attached to them, and flattered them. 
<br><br>In the next they dreaded them. 
<br><br>In the next they despised them. 
<br><br>For where faith is insufficient, it is not met by faith.
<br><br>How cautious the ancient sages were in weighing their words!
<br><br>When they had completed a meritorious work, and affairs were prosperous, the people all felt, "We are just as we are naturally."
