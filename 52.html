  <p class="title">52. Going Home to the Origin.</p>
  That which was the beginning of the world may be regarded as the Mother of the world. 
  <br><br>Having once known the Mother, you may next know the child.
  <br><br>And if, knowing the child, you still keep the Mother, though your body perish, you will be in no danger.
  <br><br>Shut the lips and close the portals of eyes and ears, and as long as you  live you will have no trouble; 
  <br>but open your lips and meddle with things, and as long as you  live you will not get out of trouble.
  <br><br>To see the small beginnings of things is called clearness. 
  <br><br>To keep tenderness, I pronounce strength. 
  <br><br>Use the light to guide you home to its own brightness, and do not give yourself up to calamity. 
  <br><br>This I call practicing eternal Tau.
