  <p class="title">65. Genuine Virtue.</p>
  Those who of old were good practitioners of Tau, did not use it to make the people bright, but rather used it to make them simple. 
  <br><br>What makes people hard to govern is their having too much policy wisdom. 
 <br><br>He who encourages this kind of policy or wisdom in the government of a kingdom is the robber of that kingdom;
  <br>and he who governs a kingdom without it is a blessing to that kingdom. 
  <br><br>To know these two things is the very ideal of government;
  <br>and a constant knowledge of this ideal. 
  <br><br>I call sublime virtue. 
  <br><br>Sublime virtue is profound, is immense, is the reverse of everything else! 
  <br><br>It will bring about a state of universal freedom.
