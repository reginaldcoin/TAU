  <p class="title">62. The Practice of Tau.</p>
  Tau is the hidden sanctuary of all things, the good man's jewel, the bad man's guardian.
  <br><br>Good words are always marketable. 
  <br><br>Honorable conduct is always transferable to others. 
  <br><br>Even if they be not good, where is the need to cast them off?
  <br><br>Therefore, in electing an emperor and appointing his nobles, if those should come bearing jewels before them and mounted on fleet steeds, they are not like the man who takes his seat, holding out this Tau as his recommendation.
  <br><br>For what did the ancients so much prize this Tau? 
  <br><br>Was it not because it was found at once without searching; and by it those who had sinned might escape or be pardoned? 
  <br><br>Therefore it is the most estimable thing in the world.
