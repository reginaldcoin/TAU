  <p class="title">10. What may be done.</p>
By husbanding the animal and spiritual souls, and embracing unity, it is possible to prevent their separation.
<br><br>By undivided attention to the passion-nature, and increasing tenderness, it is possible to be a little child.
<br><br>By putting away impurity from the hidden eye of the heart, it is possible to be without spot.    
<br><br>By loving the people, and so governing the nation, it is possible to be unknown. 
<br><br>In opening and shutting the heavenly doors, it is possible to have no creaking. 
<br><br>One may be bright and transparent on all sides, and yet be unknown.
<br><br>To produce and to nourish, to produce and have not, to act and expect not, to enlarge and cut not off, this is called sublime virtue.
