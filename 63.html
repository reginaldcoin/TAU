  Act non-action. 
  <br><br>Be occupied with non-occupation.
  <br><br>Taste the tasteless.
  <br><br>Find your great in what is little, and your many in the few.
  <br><br>Recompense injury with virtue kindness.
  <br><br>Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy.
  <br><br>Manage the great things by taking them while they are small.
  <br><br>The difficult things in the world must all originate in what is easy; 
  <br>and the great things in the world must all originate in what is small. 
  <br><br>Therefore the sage never attempts what is great, and hence he is able to accomplish great things. 
  <br><br>He who lightly assents will rarely keep his word. 
  <br><br>He who has many easy things will have many difficulties. 
  <br><br>Therefore the sage views things as difficult and never has any difficulty.
