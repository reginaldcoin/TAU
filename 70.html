  <p class="title">70. The Difficulty of Knowing.</p>
  My words are very easily known, and very easily practiced.
  <br><br>Yet none in the world can know them, or can practice them.
  <br><br>The words have an ancestry, and the things have a Head.
  <br><br>But because these are not understood, therefore I am not known.
  <br><br>Few are they who know me.
  <br><br>Worthy are they who copy me.
  <br><br>For the sage wears a coarse garment, and hides his jewel in his bosom.
