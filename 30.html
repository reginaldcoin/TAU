  <p class="title">30. Diminishing War.</p>
He who in the use of Tau renders assistance to a human ruler, does not use weapons to force the people. 
<br><br>His actions are such as he may well accept the results of or such as he would wish rendered to himself again.
<br><br>Where legions are quartered, briers and thorns grow. 
<br><br>In the track of great  armies, there must follow bad years.
<br><br>The good soldier is brave in need only to effect some good purpose. 
<br><br>He ventures nothing for the sake of power. 
<br><br>He is brave in need, but not a bully.	
<br><br>He is brave in need, but not a boaster.
<br><br>He is brave in need, but is not overbearing.
<br><br>He is brave in need, but he cannot be less.
<br><br>He is brave in need, but not violent. 
<br><br>When things reach their highest pitch of vigor, they become old.
<br><br>This is called not Tau.
<br><br>What is not Tau is soon at an end.
