  <p class="title">55. Sublime Agreement.</p>
  The man of large-hearted virtue is like an infant whom poisonous reptiles will not sting, wild beasts will not seize, and birds of  prey will not strike. 
  <br><br>His bones are tender, and his sinews weak, and yet he grasps firmly. 
  <br><br>He is unconscious of  sexual communion, and yet he has the development of sex.	
  <br><br>This is the perfection of seminal essence.	
  <br><br>He may cry all day without injuring his vocal organs. 
  <br><br>This is the perfection of harmony in his constitution. 
  <br><br>The knowledge of harmony is called ever-lasting.	
  <br><br>The knowledge of the everlasting is called brightness.
  <br><br>Fast living daily grows upon a man, and as his mind keeps in exercise the animal spirits, they daily become stronger. 
  <br><br>But whenever anything has reached its highest point of vigor, it straightway becomes old. 
  <br><br>This I call not Tau. 
  <br><br>What is not Tau soon perishes.
