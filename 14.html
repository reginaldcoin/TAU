  What you cannot see by looking at it, is called plainness.
<br><br>What you cannot hear by listening to it, is called rareness. 
<br><br>What you cannot get by grasping it, is called minuteness.
<br><br>These three cannot be examined, and therefore they blend into Unity.
<br><br>Above it is not bright,	below it is not obscure.
<br><br>Boundless in its operation, it cannot be named.
<br><br>Returning, it goes home into nothing.
<br><br>This I call the appearance of non-appearance, the form of nothing.
<br><br>This is what baffles investigation.
<br><br>Would you go before it, you cannot see its face. 
<br><br>Would you go behind it, you cannot see its back.   
<br><br>But to have such an apprehension of the Tau which was from of old as to regulate present things, and to know their beginning in the past; this I call having the clue of Tau.
