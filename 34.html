Great  Tau is all-pervading.
<br><br>It  can be on the right hand  and also at  the same time on the left.
<br><br>All things wait upon it for life, and it refuses none. 
<br><br>When its meritorious work is done, it  takes not the name of merit.
<br><br>In  love it nourishes all things, and does not lord it over them.  
<br><br>It  is ever  free from ambitious desires. 
<br><br>It may be named with the smallest. 
<br><br>All things return home to it, and it does not lord it over them.
<br><br>It may be named with the greatest, This is how the wise man, to the last, does not make himself great, and therefore he is able to achieve greatness.
