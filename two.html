  <p class="title">02. The Cultivation of the Person</p>
When in the world beauty is recognized to be beautiful, straightway there is ugliness.
<br><br>When in the world goodness is recognized to be good, straightway there is evil.
<br><br>And thus, in like manner, existence and non-existence mutually suggest each other;
<br>so also difficulty and  ease,  long  and  short,  high  and low, treble and bass, before and after. 
<br><br>The sage accordingly confines himself to what is not demonstrative. 
<br><br>He carries on teaching without words;
<br>and everything works without hindrance.
<br><br>He produces without holding possession. 
<br><br>He acts without presuming on the result. 
<br><br>He completes his work and assumes no position for himself.
<br><br>And, since he assumes no position, he never loses any.
