  <p class="title">59. Keeping Tau.</p>
  In governing men and in serving Heaven, there is nothing like moderation. 
  <br><br>This moderation, I say, is the first thing to be attained. 
  <br><br>When this is first attained, one may be said to have laid in an abundant store of virtue.   
  <br><br>With an abundant store of virtue, one may conquer every obstacle. 
  <br><br>Being able to conquer every obstacle, no limit can be seen to one's resources. 
  <br><br>And when this is the case, one may have the kingdom.
  <br><br>Such an one has the Mother of the kingdom, and may endure long. 
  <br><br>This I call having the roots deep and the fibers firm.   
  <br><br>This is the Tau by which one may live long and see many days.
