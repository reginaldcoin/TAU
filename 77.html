  <p class="title">77. The Tau of Heaven.</p>
 The Tau of Heaven may be compared to the extending of a bow.
<br><br>It brings down the high, and exalts the low.
<br><br>It takes from those who have over-much, and gives to those who have not enough.
<br><br>The Tau of Heaven takes away where there, is too much, and makes up where there is deficiency.
<br><br>Not so the Tau of man.
<br><br>Man takes from those who have not enough, to serve those who have too much.
<br><br>Who is the man that, having an overplus, can serve the world with it?
<br><br>It is only he who has Tau.
<br><br>This is the reason why the sage acts and expects nothing;
<br>completes his meritorious work and holds no place. 
<br><br>He does not wish to show his worth.
