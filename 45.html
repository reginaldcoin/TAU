  <p class="title">45. Overflowing Virtue.</p>
  He who regards his greatest achievements as unattained, may employ himself without decay.
  <br><br>He who regards his greatest fullness as emptiness, may employ himself without exhaustion.
  <br><br>His greatest uprightness is as crookedness. 
  <br><br>His greatest skill is as stupidity. 
  <br><br>His greatest eloquence is as stammering.
  <br><br>Activity conquers cold, and quietness conquers heat; 
  <br>but there is a purity and quietude by which one may rule the whole world.
