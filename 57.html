  <p class="title">57. Genuineness.</p>
  Make the upright  rule  the  nation.  
  <br><br>Make the crafty conduct the army. 
  <br><br>Make him who takes no measures emperor.
  <br><br>How do I know that this is what ought to be done? 
  <br><br>I know it from this; 
  <br>When the world has many prohibitory enactments, the people become more and more poor. 
  <br><br>When the people have many warlike weapons, the government gets more into trouble. 
  <br><br>The more craft and ingenuity that men have, the greater the number of fantastical things that come out. 
  <br><br>And, as works of cunning art are more displayed, thieves multiply.
  <br><br>Therefore the sage says, 
  <br>"I do nothing, and the people are spontaneously transformed. 
  <br>I love quietness, and the people are spontaneously rectified. 
  <br>I take no measures, and the people become spontaneously rich. 
  <br>I have no lusts, and the people become spontaneously simple-minded."
