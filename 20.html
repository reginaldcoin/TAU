  <p class="title">20. On Differing from the Vulgar.</p>
Abandon learning, and have no more vexation. 
<br><br>Not much difference, after all, is there between. 
<br><br>Aye and Yes. 
<br><br>And how much difference do they make between good and evil? 
<br><br>One must, of course, dread what others dread, such as evil.
<br><br>But, alas! 
<br><br>They will never cease from their madness. 
<br><br>All the people are full of ambitious desires, lusting as if for the stalled ox, or for sexual enjoyment.
<br><br>I am alone in my timidity, and show no sign of ambition. 
<br><br>I am as a child not yet matured. 
<br><br>I am forlorn, as if I had no home to go to. 
<br><br>Other men have enough and to spare; but I am, as it were, left behind. 
<br><br>In mind how like I am to the fool! 
<br><br>I am all in a maze. 
<br><br>The common people are brightly intelligent: I alone seem  to be in  the dark. 
<br><br>The common people are discriminative: I alone am without discrimination.
<br><br>I am tossed as the  ocean; I  roll as if  never  to stop.
<br><br>All (other) men have something that they can do: I alone am good for nothing and despicable. 
<br><br>I alone differ from other people, but I glory in my nursing Mother Tau.
