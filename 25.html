  <p class="title">25. Imagining the Abyss.</p>
There was something chaotic in nature which existed before heaven and earth.
<br><br>It was still. 
<br><br>It was void. 
<br><br>It stood alone and was not changed.   
<br><br>It pervaded everywhere and   was not endangered. 
<br><br>It may be regarded as the Mother of the Universe.   
<br><br>I know not its name; but give it the title of Tau.
<br><br>If I am forced to make a name for it, I say it is Great. 
<br><br>Being Great, I say that it passes away.
<br><br>Passing away, I say that it is far off.
<br><br>Being far off, I say that it returns.
<br><br>Now Tau is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, a king is great. 
<br><br>In the Universe there are four greatnesses, and a king is one of them. 
<br><br>Man takes his law from the Earth; 
<br>the Earth takes its law from Heaven; 
<br>Heaven takes its law from Tau; 
<br>and Tau takes its law from what it is in itself.
