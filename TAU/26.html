  <p class="title">26. The Virtue of Weight.</p>
The heavy is the root of the light.
<br><br>The still is the ruler of the moving.
<br><br>Therefore the superior man, in his daily course, never departs from quietude and gravity.
<br><br>Though he possess gorgeous palaces, he dwells calmly at a distance from them.
<br><br>Woe is me! that a ruler with ten thousand chariots should conduct himself with levity in the empire!
<br><br>By levity he loses his ministers, and by restlessness he loses his throne.
