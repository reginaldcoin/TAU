  <p class="title">74. The Delusion of Coercing.</p>
When the people do not fear death, to what purpose is death still used as a punishment to overawe them?
<br><br>And should the people be kept in continual fear of death, and I lay hold of those who are not to be so intimidated and slay them, who would dare? 
<br><br>There is always the Great Executioner.
<br><br>Now for any man to act the Executioner's part, I say, it is hewing out the Great Architect's work for him. 
<br><br>And he who undertakes to hew for the Great Architect rarely fails to cut his hands.
