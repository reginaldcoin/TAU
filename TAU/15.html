  <p class="title">15. The Manifestation of Virtue.</p>
The skillful philosophers that were in the olden time had a mystic communication with the abysses. 
<br><br>They were deep and cannot be known. 
<br><br>And whereas they cannot be known, I strain my imagination to picture them.
<br><br>Timid were they, like one fording a stream in winter.
<br><br>Cautions were they, like one who dreads his neighbor. 
<br><br>Circumspect were they,like a man from home. 
<br><br>Vanishing were they, like ice that is about to melt.
<br><br>Simple were they, like unwrought wood.
<br><br>Vacant  were they, like a valley.
<br><br>Dim were they, like muddy water.
<br><br>Who is there that can take the turbid water, and, by stillness, make it gradually clear?
<br><br>Who is there that can take what is at rest, and, by continuous motion, make it gradually alive?
<br><br>Those who keep this Tau desire not fullness. 
<br><br>And whereas they are empty, they may wax old, and yet not stand in need of renewing.
