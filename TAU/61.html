  <p class="title">61. The Virtue of Humility.</p>
  TWhen a great kingdom  takes a lowly position, it becomes the place of concourse for the world, it  is  the wife of  the world.   
  <br><br>The wife by quietness invariably conquers the man. 
  <br><br>And since quietness is also lowliness, therefore a great kingdom, by lowliness towards a small kingdom, may take that small kingdom.
  <br><br>And a small kingdom, by lowliness towards a great kingdom, may take that great kingdom. 
  <br><br>So that either the one stoops to conquer, or the other is low and conquers.
  <br><br>If the great kingdom only desires to attach to itself and nourish/benefit others, then the small kingdom will only wish to enter its service. 
  <br><br>But, in order that both may have their wish, the great one should be lowly.
