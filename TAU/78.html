  <p class="title">78. Truth to be Admitted.</p>
Of all the weak things in the world, nothing exceeds water;
<br>and yet of those who attack hard and strong things, I know not what is superior to it. 
<br><br>Don't make light of this.
<br><br>The fact that the weak can conquer the strong, and the tender the hard, is known to all the world, yet none can carry it out in practice.
<br><br>Therefore the sage says, 
<br>"He who bears the reproach of his country shall be called the lord of the land. 
<br>He who bears the calamities of his country shall be called the king of the world."
<br><br>This is the language of strict truth, though it seems paradoxical.
