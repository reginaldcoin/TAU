  <p class="title">39. Taking after the Root.</p>
The things which from of old have obtained Unity are these:
<br><br>Heaven, which by Unity is clear.
<br><br>Earth, which by Unity is steady. 
<br><br>Spirits, which by Unity are spiritual.
<br><br>The valleys, which  by  Unity are full of water.
<br><br>All creatures, which by Unity live.
<br><br>Princes and  kings, who  by Unity rule the world.
<br><br>This is all the result of Unity.
<br><br>Heaven, but for some source of clearness, would be in danger of rending.
<br><br>Earth, but for some source of steadiness, would be in danger of tumbling in pieces. 
<br><br>Spirits, but for some source of spirituality, would be in danger of  annihilation.
<br><br>Valleys, but for some source of replenishment, would be in danger of drying up.
<br><br>All creatures, but for some source of vitality, would be in danger of extinction.
<br><br>Princes and kings, were it not for some source of dignity and highness, would be in danger of an ignominious fall. 
<br><br>And here, in this last case, one sees how nobility is rooted in and entirely dependent upon what is ignoble; and highness is founded and supported upon what is low.
<br><br>Hence it is that princes and kings speak of themselves as orphans, lonely men, and wheelless carts. 
<br><br>Is this not an acknowledgment that they are rooted in and dependent upon their inferiors Deny it! 
<br><br>Why, a cart taken in pieces, is no cart. 
<br><br>A man has just as much objection to be isolated like a solitary gem, as to be lost in a crowd, like a pebble.
