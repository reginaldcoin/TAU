Tau, as it is eternal, has no name. 
<br><br>But, though it is insignificant, so little even as to have no name, in its primordial simplicity, the world dares not make a servant of it.
<br><br>If a prince or a king could keep this, everyÂ­ thing would spontaneously submit to him; 
<br>heaven and earth would combine to send down upon him refreshing dew; 
<br>and the people, without orders, would of themselves harmonize together.
<br><br>If he should ever begin to regulate things with distinctions of names, he would then be getting a name; 
<br>but he would know to stop at that point, and thereby escape the danger.
<br><br>Tau, as it exists in this world, is like the streams and valleys in relation to the great rivers and seas.
