  <p class="title">38. On Virtue.</p>
The superior virtue is not distinguished virtue, and therefore it has the essence of virtue. 
<br><br>The inferior virtue does not lose the distinction of virtue, and therefore it has no essential virtue. 
<br><br>The superior virtue does not act a part, and makes no pretensions.
<br><br>The inferior virtue acts a part, and makes pretensions.
<br><br>The superior benevolence does act, but it does not make pretensions.
<br><br>The superior justice both acts and makes pretensions.
<br><br>The superior propriety acts a part, and nobody responds to it;
<br>so it bares its arm and enacts itself by main force.
<br><br>Thus it is that, when Tau is lost, virtue comes after; 
<br>when virtue is lost, benevolence comes after; 
<br>when benevolence is lost, justice comes after; 
<br><br>when justice is lost, propriety comes after.
<br><br>For propriety is the mere skeleton of fidelity and faith, and the precursor of confusion. 
<br><br>Surface-knowledge is the mere show, the flowers, of Tau, and the beginning of folly.
<br><br>Accordingly the great man abides by the solid, and never rests in what is flimsy. 
<br><br>He abides by the real, and never rests in what is showy.
<br><br>For he puts away the one, that he may lay hold of the other.
