  <p class="title">19. Restoring Genuineness.</p>
If some men would but abandon their holiness, and cast away their wisdom, the people would be more benefited a hundredfold.
<br><br>If they would abandon their philanthropy, and cast away their justice, the people would go back to filial duty and fatherly compassion.
<br><br>If they would abandon their skill and forego their gains, thieves would have no existence. 
<br><br>Here are three things, the cultivation of which has been a failure. 
<br><br>Therefore let them return to whence they came; and do you appear in your own unadorned simplicity, embracing realities, curbing selfishness, and curtailing ambitious desire.
