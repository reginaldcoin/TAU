Faithful words are not fine. 
<br><br>Fine words are not faithful. 
<br><br>The good do not debate. 
<br><br>The debater is not good. 
<br><br>The knowing are not learned. 
<br><br>The learned are not knowing.
<br><br>The sage does not lay up treasures.   
<br><br>The more he does for others, the more he has of his own. 
<br><br>The more he gives to others, the more he is increased.
<br><br>This is the Tau of Heaven, which benefits and does not injure.
<br><br>This is the Tau of the sage, who acts but does not strive.
