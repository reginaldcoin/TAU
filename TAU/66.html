  That by which the rivers and seas are the rulers of all the smaller valleys is their keeping well down.
  <br><br>This is the reason why they reign over all the smaller valleys.
  <br><br>Therefore the sage, when he wishes to be above to rule the people, must, in his language, keep below them.
  <br><br>When he wishes to be before the people he must, in his person, keep behind them.
  <br><br>In this way, while the sage really occupies a position above the people, they do not feel his weight.
  <br><br>And while he occupies a position before the people, they do not suffer any inconvenience. 
  <br><br>Therefore the world delights to exalt him, and no one is offended.
  <br><br>Because he strives not, therefore none in the world can possibly strive with him.
