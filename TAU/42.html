  <p class="title">42. The Transformation of Tau.</p>
  Tau produced one unity; 
  <br>one unity produced duality; 
  <br>duality produced trinity; 
  <br>and trinity produced all things.
  <br><br>Everything carries the yin on its back; 
  <br>and the yang on its front; 
  <br>and is harmonized by an intermediate immaterial breath.
  <br><br>What people dislike is orphanage, and loneliness, and a wheelless carriage incompleteness; 
  <br>and yet kings and nobles appropriate these terms. 
  <br><br>For things, when they are diminished, will increase; 
  <br>and, when they are increased, will diminish.
  <br><br>What people by their behavior teach, I also teach them. 
  <br><br>Those, for instance, who are violent and obstinate do not die a natural death.
  <br><br>I would use such as the best instructors.
