  <p class="title">27. The Tau of Skill.</p>
The good walker leaves no traces behind him. 
<br><br>The good speaker incurs no blame. 
<br><br>The good reckoner needs no arithmetic. 
<br><br>The good closer needs no bolts and bars;
<br>and to open after him is impossible. 
<br><br>The good fastener needs no cord;
<br><br>and to loose after him is impossible.
<br><br>The sage is ever the good savior of men. 
<br><br>He rejects none.  
<br><br>He is ever the good savior of things.
<br><br>He rejects nothing.
<br><br>This I call comprehensive intelligence. 
<br><br>For the good men are the instructors of other good men; 
<br><br>and the bad men are the material of the good men to be worked upon. 
<br><br>He, then, who honors not his instructor, and he who loves not his material, though accounted wise, are greatly deluded. 
<br><br>This is no less important than wonderful.
