  <p class="title">50. Valuing Life.</p>
  Men go out of life and into death.
  <br><br>The  ministers  of life are thirteen senses of beyond.
  <br><br>The ministers of death are thirteen.
  <br><br>Human life hastens to the place of death in thirteen ways by the undue exercise of the senses and limbs. 
  <br><br>And why is this?
  <br><br>It is because the life men are striving to live is only the gross physical life of intensified activity.
  <br><br>I have heard it said, that a man that is good at taking care of his life may travel over the country without meeting a rhinoceros or a tiger, and may enter an armed host without fearing their steel.
  <br><br>The rhinoceros finds in him no place to insert his horn;
  <br>the tiger finds no place to fix his claw;
  <br>the weapon finds no place to receive its blade. 
  <br><br>And why is this?
  <br><br>It is because he is beyond the reach of death.
