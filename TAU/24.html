  <p class="title">24. Disagreeable Graciousness.</p>
A man on tiptoe cannot stand still. 
<br><br>A man astride his neighbor cannot walk on.
<br><br>He who is self-displaying does not shine. 
<br><br>He who is self-approving is not held in esteem. 
<br><br>He who is self-praising has no merit. 
<br><br>He who is self-exalting does not stand high.
<br><br>Such persons are in relation to Tau, as the refuse of food or as excrescences on the body to the creature; 
<br>they are universally loathed.
<br><br>Therefore he who has Tau will not stay where they are.
