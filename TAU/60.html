  <p class="title">60. On Occupying the Throne.</p>
  Govern a great kingdom as you would cook small fry, without gutting or scraping.
  <br><br>When  one  brings  Tau  with  him  to  the  government of the world, ghosts will not become active spirits.
  <br><br>It is not that ghosts will not become active spirits, but the spirits or ghosts will not injure men.
  <br><br>Once more, it is not the spirits or ghosts that will not injure men, it is the sage himself that will not injure men. 
  <br><br>Inasmuch as he and they do not injure each other, their virtues converge to one beneficent end.
