  <p class="title">67. Three Precious Things.</p>
  While all the world says I am great, I am, to all appearance, an incompetent creature. 
  <br><br>But, indeed, if I am great, I appear, for this very reason, to be an incompetent creature.
  <br><br>Those who come up to the vulgar standard have existed for a long time as small men.
  <br><br>As for me, I have three precious things which I hold fast and prize.
  <br><br>The first is called compassion, the second is called economy, and the third is called not daring to take the precedence of the world. 
  <br><br>Being compassionate, I can therefore be brave. 
  <br><br>Being economical, I can therefore be free. 
  <br><br>Not daring to take the precedence of the world, I can therefore become the chief of all the perfect ones.
  <br><br>But in the present day, men give up compassion and cultivate only courage. 
  <br><br>They give up economy and aim only at freedom. 
  <br><br>They give up the last place and  only seek  the first. 
  <br><br>It is their death. 
  <br><br>Compassion is that which is victorious in the attack, and secure in the defense. 
  <br><br>When Heaven would save a man, it encircles him with compassion.
