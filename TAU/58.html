  <p class="title">58. Letting others be Transformed.</p>
  When the government is blindly open, the people are rich and noble. 
  <br><br>When the government is pryingly strict, the people are needy and miserable.
  <br><br>Happiness is ever built up on the back of misery. Misery is ever lurking under happiness. 
  <br><br>Who know where this will end?
  <br><br>If one be himself devoid of uprightness, the upright will become crafty, the good will be come depraved. 
  <br><br>Verily, mankind have been under delusion for many a day.
  <br><br>Therefore the sage is himself strictly correct, but does not cut and carve Other people.    
  <br><br>He is chaste, but does not chasten others. 
  <br><br>He is straight, but does not straighten others.	
  <br><br>He is enlightened, but does not dazzle others.
