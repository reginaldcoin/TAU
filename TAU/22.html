  <p class="title">22. The Increase of Humility.</p>
He that humbles him-self shall be preserved entire.
<br><br>He that bends shall be straightened. 
<br><br>He that is low shall be filled.
<br><br>He that is worn out shall be renewed. 
<br><br>He that is diminished shall succeed.
<br><br>He that is increased shall be misled.
<br><br>Therefore the sage embraces Unity, and is a pattern for all the world. 
<br><br>He is not self-displaying, and, therefore, he shines.  
<br><br>He is not self-approving, and, therefore, he is distinguished. 
<br><br>He is not self-praising, and, therefore, he has merit.
<br><br>He is not self-exalting, and, therefore, he stands high.
<br><br>And inasmuch as he does not strive, no one in all the world strives with him.
<br><br>That ancient saying, "He that humbles him-self shall be preserved entire," 
<br>Oh; it is no vain utterance I Verily, he shall be returned home entire to his origin.
