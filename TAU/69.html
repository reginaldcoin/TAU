  <p class="title">69. The Practice of Sublime Virtue.</p>
  A certain person of military experience has said,
  <br>"I dare not be the host, to lead on the fight; 
  <br>I would rather be the guest. 
  <br>I dare not advance an inch, to make the first attack; 
  <br>I would rather retire a foot."   
  <br><br>Now this principle if carried out would, I say, result in there being no following of ranks, no baring of the arm, no charging of the enemy, no grasping of weapons.
  <br><br>There is no calamity greater than making light of the enemy. 
  <br><br>By making light of the enemy, we are almost sure to lose our treasure. 
  <br><br>Therefore, when opposing warriors join in battle, the pitiful is always the conqueror.
