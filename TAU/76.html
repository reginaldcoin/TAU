  <p class="title">76. Against Strength.</p>
Man in his life is supple and tender, in his death he is rigid and strong.
<br><br>It is the same with everything.
<br><br>Grass and trees are, in their life, weak and tender, and, in their death, withered and tough.
<br><br>Therefore the rigid and the strong are the attendants of death; 
<br>and the tender and weak the attendants of life.
<br><br>Hence the warrior, when strong, does not conquer. 
<br><br>When a tree is strong, it becomes a mere support: the strong and big must stay  below, while the tender and weak stay above.
