Be sparing of your talk, and possess your-self.
<br><br>A violent wind will not outlast the morning.
<br><br>A pouring rain will not outlast the day.
<br><br>Who are they that make these but Heaven and Earth? 
<br><br>And, if Heaven and Earth cannot continue such things long, how much more will this be the case with man?
<br><br>Therefore, when a man in all things accords with Tau, his accordance with Tau identifies him with Tau. 
<br><br>A man of virtue is identified with virtue, A man of default is identified with default.
<br><br>Him who is identified with Tau, the community of Tau also rejoices to receive. 
<br><br>Him who is identified with Virtue, the community of Virtue also rejoices to receive. 
<br><br>But him who is identified with default, the defaulters also rejoice to visit with default. 
<br><br>Where faith is insufficient, it is not met by faith.
