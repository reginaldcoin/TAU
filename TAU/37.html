Tau is ever inactive; and yet leaves nothing undone.
<br><br>If a prince or a king could keep it, all things would be, of their own accord, transformed to his likeness.
<br><br>If during the process of transformation, there should be any manifestation of desire, I would restrain it by the nameless Simplicity.
<br><br>The nameless Simplicity would also produce an absence of all desire, which would again result in quietude i and the world would rectify itself.
