  <p class="title">80. Standing Alone.</p>
Suppose I had a small kingdom with few people, and only some tens or hundreds of men available for service, I would not use them.
<br><br>I would make the people think death a grievous thing; and then they would not roam to a distance. 
<br><br>Though they might have boats and carriages, they would not ride away in them. 
<br><br>Though they might have armor, they would have no occasion to put it on.  
<br><br>I would make the people return to the use of the knotted cords, relish their food, think their clothes elegant, rest happily in their homes, take pleasure in their own simple habits.
<br><br>While  neighboring  nations  might be  within  sight,  and  cocks  crowing  and dogs barking might be within hearing one of another, yet the people would grow old and die, without going and coming together.
