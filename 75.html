  The people suffer from famine by reason of exorbitant taxation.	
<br><br>This is the cause of famine.
<br><br>The people are difficult to govern, because their superiors make so much ado. 
<br><br>This is the reason of the difficulty. 
<br><br>The people make light of death, because they seek to live in wealth. 
<br><br>This is the reason of their making light of death.
<br><br>But only he who takes no measures what-ever for life is above all this selfishness is superior to him who highly esteems life.
