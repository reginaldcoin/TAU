  <p class="title">13. Avoiding Shame.</p>
Favor  and disgrace  are  as  one's  fear.
<br><br>Dignity and disaster as one's person.
<br><br>What I  mean to say of favor and disgrace is this-
<br>Disgrace is the lower place, which he who wins and he who loses equally fear;
<br>so that in the struggle for position, favor and disgrace are only important in proportion to one's fear of failure.
<br><br>And what I mean by dignity and disaster being as one's person is this-
<br>What renders me liable to great disaster is my person; 
<br>so that if I had no person, what disaster could I have?
<br><br>So then, if, for the sake of dignity, one seeks to make himself ruler of the world, he may be permitted, indeed, to rule it temporarily; 
<br>but if, for love, one seeks to make himself ruler of the world, he may be entrusted with it for ever.
