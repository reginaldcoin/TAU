  <p class="title">73. Freedom of Action.</p>
  One man who has the courage to dare, will be slain; 
  <br>and another who has the courage to restrain himself not to dare, will survive. 
  <br><br>Of these two, one seems to have the advantage and the other the damage.
  <br><br>But who can tell why either of them should be the object of Heaven's hatred? 
  <br><br>This is why the sage holds it difficult to act.
  <br><br>The Tau of Heaven does not strive, yet conquers well, 
  <br>does not speak, yet answers well, 
  <br>does not call, yet things come of their own accord, 
  <br>is slack, yet plans  well.  
  <br><br>The net of heaven is very wide in its meshes, and yet misses nothing.
