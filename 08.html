  <p class="title">08. The Easy Nature.</p>
The highest style of goodness is like water. 
<br><br>Water is good to benefit all things; 
<br>while it does not strive, but runs to the place which all men disdain. 
<br><br>Therefore it is near to Tau. 
<br><br>Where it abides, it is good for adaptability.   
<br><br>In its heart, it is good for depth. 
<br><br>In giving, it is good for benevolence.   
<br><br>In speaking, it is good for fidelity. 
<br><br>In correcting, it is good for government.    
<br><br>In serving, it is good for ability. 
<br><br>In acting, it is good for seasonableness. 
<br><br>And inasmuch as it does not strive no one dislikes it.
