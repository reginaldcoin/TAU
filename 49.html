  <p class="title">49. The Virtue of Indulgence.</p>
  The sage has no invariable mind of his own; 
  <br>he makes the mind of the people his mind. 
  <br>The good I would meet with goodness.
  <br><br>The not-good I would also meet with goodness. 
  <br><br>Virtue is good.	
  <br><br>The faithful I would meet with faith.	
  <br><br>The not-faithful I would also meet with faith.  
  <br><br>Virtue is faithful.
  <br><br>The sage dwells in the world with a timid reserve;
  <br>but his mind blends in sympathy with all.
  <br><br>The people all turn their ears and eyes up to him;
  <br>and the sage thinks of them all as his children.
