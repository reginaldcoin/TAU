  When the superior scholar hears Tau, he diligently practices it. 
  <br><br>When the middling scholar hears Tau, he one while keeps it, another while loses it. 
  <br><br>When the inferior scholar hears Tau, he laughs aloud at it. 
  <br><br>Were it not thus laughed at, it would not be worthy of the name of Tau.
  <br><br>Therefore those who have spoken before me have said:
  <br>"The bright in Tau are as darkness black; 
  <br>The advanced in Tau are as going back; 
  <br>And their lofty way seems a vulgar track.
  <br><br>The highest Virtue is a lowly vale;
  <br>The greatest pureness, like the vile canaille; 
  <br>The vastest talents, those that seem to fail. 
  <br><br>Established virtue is a11 stolen away;
  <br>The truest essence is all foul decay;
  <br>The greatest square has no angles aye. 
  <br><br>The largest vessel takes long to make; 
  <br>The loudest voice is what never spake;
  <br>The biggest form ne'er a shape doth take."
  <br><br>Tau is hidden, and has no name; 
  <br>but Tau is good at imparting and completing.
