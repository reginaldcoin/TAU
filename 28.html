  <p class="title">28. Returning to Simplicity.</p>
He who knows the masculine nature, and at the same time keeps the feminine, will be the whole world's channel, the center of universal attraction.
<br><br>Being the whole world's channel, eternal Virtue will not depart from him; and he will return again to the state of an infant.
<br><br>He who knows the light, and at the same time keeps the shade, will be the whole world's model.
<br><br>Being the whole world's model, eternal Virtue will not miss him, and he will return home to the Absolute.
<br><br>He who knows the glory, and at the same time keeps the shame, will be the whole world's valley.
<br><br>Being the whole world's valley, eternal Virtue will fill him, and lie will return home to Simplicity.
<br><br>This Simplicity is what, being distributed, becomes vessels.
<br><br>A wise man, if he embrace it, becomes the chief of governors.
<br><br>For wise government is that which cuts off or hurts nobody.
