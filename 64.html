  That which is at rest is easily held. 
  <br><br>That which has not yet appeared is easily provided against. 
  <br><br>That which is brittle is easily broken. 
  <br><br>That which is minute is easily dispersed.
  <br><br>Manage your business before it takes form. 
  <br><br>Begin to regulate before he disorder comes.    
  <br><br>The tree that fills the arms grew from a slender twig. 
  <br><br>The castle of nine stories was raised from a mound of earth. 
  <br><br>The journey of a thousand miles commenced with one pace.
  <br><br>He that makes mars. 
  <br><br>He that grasps loses. 
  <br><br>The sage makes nothing, therefore he mars nothing. 
  <br><br>He grasps  nothing, therefore  he loses nothing.
  <br><br>People undertake things, and always fail when they are on the point of succeeding. 
  <br><br>If they were as careful of the end as they usually are of the beginning there would be no failures.
  <br><br>Therefore the sage is ambitious of no ambition; 
  <br>and he does not prize things difficult to get. 
  <br><br>He learns no learning; 
  <br>and only reverts to what others have passed over;
  <br>his aim being to promote spontaneity in all things, 
  <br>while he dares not act upon them.
