  <p class="title">16. Going Home to the Root.</p>
Having once arrived at a state of absolute vacuity, keep yourself perfectly still.
<br><br>All things come into active operation together; but I observe whither they return. 
<br><br>When things have luxuriated for a while, each returns home to its origin root. 
<br><br>Going home to the origin  is called stillness.  
<br><br>It is said to be a reversion to destiny. 
<br><br>This reversion to destiny is called eternity. 
<br><br>He who knows eternity is called bright.   
<br><br>He who does not know eternity wildly works his own misery. 
<br><br>He who knows eternity is magnanimous. 
<br><br>Being magnanimous, he is all knowing.  
<br><br>Being all knowing, he is a king.    
<br><br>Being a king, he is heaven. 
<br><br>Being heaven, he is Tau.
<br><br>Being Tau, he is enduring. 
<br><br>Though his body perish, he is in no danger.
