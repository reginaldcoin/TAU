  <p class="title">31. Ceasing from War.</p>
Ornamental weapons are not instruments of joy, but objects of hatred to every creature. 
<br><br>Therefore he who has Tau will not stay where they are.
<br><br>The superior man in his home makes the left hand, the weak side, the place of honor.
<br><br>But he who goes forth to use weapons of war honors the right, the strong, hand. 
<br><br>They are instruments of evil omen. 
<br><br>They are not the tools of a superior man.
<br><br>He uses them only when he cannot help it.
<br><br>Peace is his highest aim. When he conquers he is not elated, to be elated is to rejoice at the destruction of human life.
<br><br>And he who rejoices at the destruction of human life, is not fit to be entrusted with power in the world.
<br><br>In a prosperous state of affairs, the left side is preferred; and in an adverse state of affairs, the right side is preferred. 
<br><br>The adjutant-general takes his place on the left, and the general-in-chief takes his place on the right. 
<br><br>Now, I say, this is just the order of a funeral. 
<br><br>He who has been instrumental in killing many people should mourn over them with bitter tears. 
<br><br>Therefore, those who have been victorious in battle are disposed after the order of a funeral.
